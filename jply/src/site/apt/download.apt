How to get jPLY?

* For Maven Users

  TODO

* For everybody else

  We have a {{{https://github.com/smurn/jPly/downloads}download page}} where
you can get the jar file for jPLY.

  Note that jPLY depends on 
{{{http://commons.apache.org/lang/download_lang.cgi}Apache Commons Lang 3.1}}
so you need to get this library too.

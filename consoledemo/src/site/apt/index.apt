jPLY Console Demo Application

  This is a small demo application of the {{{../index.html}jPLY}} library
to read files in the PLY format.

  This application does nothing but opening a PLY file and dumping the 
coordinates of the vertices to the console. 

  Go ahead and have a look at the 
{{{./xref/org/smurn/jply/consoledemo/ConsoleDemo.html}Source Code}}.
